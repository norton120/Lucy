_autonomous enabled workflow/perpetual agent for multi-tenant, multi-user applications_

### Why
We have a collection of use cases that need this. So Sid is the abstraction where we figure this out together.

### Minimum Viable Capabilities
- **Perpetual chat with context recall**
  if you tell a Sid agent that "I fucking love pickles" and later ask the agent or order me a sandwich, the bot should say "extra pickles, right?"
- **Agency via Python functions**
  a clean factory for providing agents with functions they can invoke and iterate with
- **Multi: User, Tenant, Agent**
  reflect almost every SaaS application on Earth - orgs/teams/companies have many users. Agents can differentiate between different users, different teams, and the relationship between the two.
- **Task Solving**
  Agents can be given work to do and/or things to accomplish with the user, like getting status on a project or booking a flight.
- **grown-ass scalability**
  can be deployed in a container, scaled horizontally, load balanced, replicated across zones etc.
